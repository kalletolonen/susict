## Elements of sustainable ICT

### 7.1.2025

People have different first thoughts of what are the elements of susict.

Related to UN's definitions of sustainability

The course is mostly about sustainability of energy usage

What's ICT in your daily life - communication, entertainment, there's a lot of different views
from people of different backgrounds. Sensors and networks, a lot of things that are
"invisible" are ICT too.

We can divide the topic into handprint (what good does a thing bring) and footprint (what bad things does ICT bring).

ICT industry likes to promote the benefits - we're here to try to understand the costs of using ICT.

We should look into this from a holistic viewpoint, a smartphone needs resources and a lot of other ICT-services to function.

### Overview of topics

2023 Google matched their energy use with renevables, but they do use more of it. Should we just use less instead? 

Datacenters will use more resources in the future, that's the trend. Consumer devices are not using as much as they used to. 1 Apple's datacenter might for example increase Ireland's electricity usage dramatically.

Networks use electricity, and they're wireless and wired. There's a lot of networks in the world.

Renewable energy also has emissions, nothing is without a cost. That would be against enthropy. Lifecycle emissions are smallest for nuclear power in Europe. The grid is getting greener, atleast in Europe.

There's a lot of raw materials used in devices, many of them are problematic. We should consider the thing holistically. A smartphone might include 70 different elements.

Tech gets better with time. Processing power has gotten cheaper and much more energy efficient. We just use a lot more of it. Networks have gotten faster too, and we use a lot more of it too. We need also a lot of energy for cooling, in addition to the actual calculation.

Digital services have a lot of more users than they had in the past. Europe & US are quite saturated in terms of internet access. There's a 6% CAGR for users currently. Embedded devices grow faster than traditional devices. Most of the global IP-traffic is videos. Cat videos lead to a lot of emissions and the share is still growing. Cryptocurrencies use a lot of energy too, Bitcoin uses a lot more energy than Finland.

AI-usage and model training use a lot of energy.

Cellular network usage has stabilized in Western countries. Potentially even peaked.

Unefficient programming languages are gaining popularity.
