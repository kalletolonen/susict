# Elements of sustainable ICT

## 7.1.2025

### Overview

We consume a lot more than what we used to. Processing power has gotten cheaper and more abundand. We also use a lot of network resources. Both of these things lead to a lot more co2 and energy usage. Even renewable energy sources aren't something that we should use without consideration since they do produce lifecycle emissions. People have different first thoughts of what are the elements of SusIct. We should take a holistic view when we're looking into the topic, since ICT-companies like to emphatize the good effect of ICT (eg. the handprint). Video is growing at a staggering rate and the Western world might have already peaked in network usage. AI is another growth driver. The course is mostly about sustainability of energy usage.


### Key learnings
1. ICT-industry likes to promote the benefits - we're here to try to understand the costs of using ICT.

2. We should look into this from a holistic viewpoint, a smartphone needs resources and a lot of other ICT-services to function and a smartphone might include 70 different elements.

3. 2023 Google matched their energy use with renevables, but they do use more of it. Datacenters will use more resources in the future, that's the trend. Consumer devices are not using as much as they used to. 1 Apple's datacenter might for example increase Ireland's electricity usage dramatically.

4. Renewable energy also has emissions, nothing is without a cost. That would be against enthropy. Lifecycle emissions are smallest for nuclear power in Europe. The grid is getting greener, atleast in Europe.

5. Unefficient programming languages are gaining popularity.

### Notes
-Finnish corporation has developed measuring tools
-Modern datacenters consume a substantial amount of power & cooling
-Nordic datacenters can use 'free cooling' & use waste heat for district heating
-Power outages are not a problem
-UPS can be used for electricity arbitrage

-Applications live in the datacenters
-On-prem, private & public clouds
-Private cloud is private, public is something like AWS & Azure
-Edge computing optimizes latency

-Cooling takes about 40% of dc electricity
-Connectivity takes most of the energy
-Architecture runs in waves, we're changing between virtual to physical and centralized & distributed

-DC is an optimization game, just like everything else. You need to live with constraints
-Saas is a cloud service
	-Company provides software that runs in cloud, makes things easy for customers
-Customer expectations
	-Certified security
	-Scalability
	-Green values & easy reporting for scope 3
	-Really good connectivity

DC business model
Enterprise:
-company owns their own stuff on their own location
-low availability
-expensive/unit of compute
-<1MW
-Full control

Colocation
-Own stuff in someone else's place
-High availability
-Cheaper/unit of compute
-Less control
-<50MW

Hyperscale
-Giant workloads
-Economies of scale
-High availability
-Cheapest/unit
-Little control
->150MW

Colocation grows fast, hyperscalers use colocation centers as edge DC to reduce latency. Colocations are certified for many things ie. money transfer, env issues & security. You can buy a Â½-rack or a whole floor if you'd like to.

TIER IV DC's are 99,995%
TIER III DC's are 99,982%
etc.

More redundancy and availability have costs.

DC's have a plethora of different energy systems. We need energy and cooling both.

Ambient temperature helps in north. GPU's need liquid cooling.
DC's have physical security and it security both.

DCIM monitors everything.

Certs give confirmation and validation to customers.

PUE = TOTAL ENERGY / IT ENERGY
Scandinavian DCs perform well in measurements

DCs are a stable and predictable heat source. Other person's trash is a treasure for someone else.

AI search can be 10* more expensive than regular search
