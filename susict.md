# Elements of sustainable ICT

## 07.01.2025

### Overview

We consume a lot more than what we used to. Processing power has gotten cheaper and more abundand. We also use a lot of network resources. Both of these things lead to a lot more co2 and energy usage. Even renewable energy sources aren't something that we should use without consideration since they do produce lifecycle emissions. People have different first thoughts of what are the elements of SusIct. We should take a holistic view when we're looking into the topic, since ICT-companies like to emphatize the good effect of ICT (eg. the handprint). Video is growing at a staggering rate and the Western world might have already peaked in network usage. AI is another growth driver. The course is mostly about sustainability of energy usage.


### Key learnings
1. ICT-industry likes to promote the benefits - we're here to try to understand the costs of using ICT.

2. We should look into this from a holistic viewpoint, a smartphone needs resources and a lot of other ICT-services to function and a smartphone might include 70 different elements.

3. 2023 Google matched their energy use with renevables, but they do use more of it. Datacenters will use more resources in the future, that's the trend. Consumer devices are not using as much as they used to. 1 Apple's datacenter might for example increase Ireland's electricity usage dramatically.

4. Renewable energy also has emissions, nothing is without a cost. That would be against enthropy. Lifecycle emissions are smallest for nuclear power in Europe. The grid is getting greener, atleast in Europe.

5. Unefficient programming languages are gaining popularity.

### Overview

Modern datacenters consume a substantial amount of power & cooling. Nordic datacenters can use 'free cooling' & use waste heat for district heating. UPS-systems can be used for electricity arbitrage. Connectivity takes most of the overall energy and cooling takes about 40% of DC electricity. DC's are an optimization game, just like everything else. You need to live with constraints. Architecture runs in waves, we're changing between virtual to physical and centralized & distributed. Customer expectations are plentiful: certified security, scalability, green values & easy reporting for scope 3 & really good connectivity are some of the key requirements. There are 3 main categories of DC's: owned by enterprise, colocation and hyperscale. Hyperscale DC's offer the cheapest price, uptime and least control and enterpise solutions have the least of those, while colocation is the middle child with elements of both. Having better availability costs more.

### Key learnings
-AI search can be an order or magnitude more expensive than traditional search
-DCs are a stable and predictable heat source. Other person's trash is someone else's treasure.
-Certs give confirmation and validation to customers
-Server racks consume a lot of power

### Notes
- Electricity consumption will double in 10 years
- There are different types of energy
- ICT energy consumption is huge
- Global energy is still mainly produces with fossil fuels
- Canada, US & Australia are big fossil fuel hogs
- Renewable sources are slowly increasing and eating up the the fossil part of the mix
- Hydro is the largest part of renewables and Wind & Solar are the fastest growers
- Finnish electricity consumption (83tWh) hasn't increased from 2004ish
- Finland has 3rd lowest electricity prices in Europe
- Wind power makes prices volatile
- Wind & Solar, Nuclear, Hydro have low variable costs
- There's elasticity in electricity demand, it can be balanced with storage and pricing
- There are electricity market places for 10y to 15 minute window
- Europe has an interconnected electricity market, there's a lot of trading going on
- There are contracts to buy electricity at steady prices and you can also buy "Wind energy", ie. buy a certain amount of kWh and the supplier has to produce that amount during the time window
- There's a plan to secure critical energy supply
- We need reserve markets to keep the frequency balanced - it needs to be within tolerance or the grid will fail
- ICT requires a lot of batteries to prepare for disturbances, and you can make money from your capacity when it's not needed for current operations
- ICT stakeholders appreaciate single price region in Finland
- Combined production of heat & electricity is quite efficient, it's used in wintertime
- Biomass has incraesed it's share of DH's energy sources
- District heating can utilize the heat that's generated in DC operation
	- Needs priming to higher temperature
	- There a mismatch in heat supply and heat demand
	- Also a risk for reliability since DC's can go bankrupt etc.
	- There's emerging tech in heat storage
- What can you do
	- You can personally make sure to use renevables
	- Utilize waste heat
	- Seek efficiency
- Datacenter investment is growing b/c AI
	- DC's use great amount of energy in one spot
	- DC's will have energy storage
- In the future we should couple DC's, energy sector and city planning
