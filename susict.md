## Elements of sustainable ICT

### 7.1.2025

### Overview

We consume a lot more than what we used to. Processing power has gotten cheaper and more abundand. We also use a lot of network resources. Both of these things lead to a lot more co2 and energy usage. Even renewable energy sources aren't something that we should use without consideration since they do produce lifecycle emissions. People have different first thoughts of what are the elements of SusIct. We should take a holistic view when we're looking into the topic, since ICT-companies like to emphatize the good effect of ICT (eg. the handprint). Video is growing at a staggering rate and the Western world might have already peaked in network usage. AI is another growth driver. The course is mostly about sustainability of energy usage.


### Key learnings
1. ICT-industry likes to promote the benefits - we're here to try to understand the costs of using ICT.

2. We should look into this from a holistic viewpoint, a smartphone needs resources and a lot of other ICT-services to function and a smartphone might include 70 different elements.

3. 2023 Google matched their energy use with renevables, but they do use more of it. Datacenters will use more resources in the future, that's the trend. Consumer devices are not using as much as they used to. 1 Apple's datacenter might for example increase Ireland's electricity usage dramatically.

4. Renewable energy also has emissions, nothing is without a cost. That would be against enthropy. Lifecycle emissions are smallest for nuclear power in Europe. The grid is getting greener, atleast in Europe.

5. Unefficient programming languages are gaining popularity.
