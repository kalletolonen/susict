# Elements of sustainable ICT

## 07.01.2025

### Overview

We consume a lot more than what we used to. Processing power has gotten cheaper and more abundand. We also use a lot of network resources. Both of these things lead to a lot more co2 and energy usage. Even renewable energy sources aren't something that we should use without consideration since they do produce lifecycle emissions. People have different first thoughts of what are the elements of SusIct. We should take a holistic view when we're looking into the topic, since ICT-companies like to emphatize the good effect of ICT (eg. the handprint). Video is growing at a staggering rate and the Western world might have already peaked in network usage. AI is another growth driver. The course is mostly about sustainability of energy usage.


### Key learnings
1. ICT-industry likes to promote the benefits - we're here to try to understand the costs of using ICT.

2. We should look into this from a holistic viewpoint, a smartphone needs resources and a lot of other ICT-services to function and a smartphone might include 70 different elements.

3. 2023 Google matched their energy use with renevables, but they do use more of it. Datacenters will use more resources in the future, that's the trend. Consumer devices are not using as much as they used to. 1 Apple's datacenter might for example increase Ireland's electricity usage dramatically.

4. Renewable energy also has emissions, nothing is without a cost. That would be against enthropy. Lifecycle emissions are smallest for nuclear power in Europe. The grid is getting greener, atleast in Europe.

5. Unefficient programming languages are gaining popularity.

### Overview

Modern datacenters consume a substantial amount of power & cooling. Nordic datacenters can use 'free cooling' & use waste heat for district heating. UPS-systems can be used for electricity arbitrage. Connectivity takes most of the overall energy and cooling takes about 40% of DC electricity. DC's are an optimization game, just like everything else. You need to live with constraints. Architecture runs in waves, we're changing between virtual to physical and centralized & distributed. Customer expectations are plentiful: certified security, scalability, green values & easy reporting for scope 3 & really good connectivity are some of the key requirements. There are 3 main categories of DC's: owned by enterprise, colocation and hyperscale. Hyperscale DC's offer the cheapest price, uptime and least control and enterpise solutions have the least of those, while colocation is the middle child with elements of both. Having better availability costs more.

### Key learnings
-AI search can be an order or magnitude more expensive than traditional search
-DCs are a stable and predictable heat source. Other person's trash is someone else's treasure.
-Certs give confirmation and validation to customers
-Server racks consume a lot of power


## 21.01.2025

### Overview
There are different types of energy and electricity consumption will double in 10 years. ICT's energy consumption is huge. Global energy is still mainly produces with fossil fuels and Canada, US & Australia are big fossil fuel hogs. Renewable sources are slowly increasing and eating up the the fossil part of the mix: hydro is the largest part of renewables and wind & solar are the fastest growers. Finnish electricity consumption (83tWh) hasn't increased from 2004ish, I would say that's because we haven't had any meaningfull growth in economy either, since all business requires energy.

There's elasticity in electricity demand, it can be balanced with storage and pricing and there's a market where you can take trade in energy. We  also need reserve markets to keep the frequency balanced - it needs to be within tolerance or the grid will fail. ICT requires a lot of batteries to prepare for disturbances, and you can make money from your capacity when it's not needed for current operations. Combined production of heat & electricity is quite efficient, it's used in wintertime and Biomass has incraesed it's share of District Heatings' energy sources. District heating can utilize the heat that's generated in DC operation, but it does need some priming to get it up to required temperatures and currently there isn't much need for the heat during summer. In the future we should couple DC's, energy sector and city planning and also store the heat generated in non-peak times for future use. DC energy usage is only going skywards, since there's growing investment into AI.

### Key learnings
- There's opportunity for innovation in heat storage
- There's opportunity in energy storage
- Finland has one of the lowest prices of electricity and the whole country is priced as a whole, which is tempting to DC investment
- There's a mismatch in DC heat energy supply and demand
- The grid needs to be balanced at all times

## 28.01.2025 Networks and Services

### Overview
There are data centers of various sizes, core networks, last mile networks & user devices. Data centers have high variablity in energy consumption, networks have intermediate differences, "last mile" can have big impact in corporate environments and user devices have high variablity in resource consumption. Energy consumption in switching from consumers to networks and DC's and AI is the new big dog for energy consumption. 

Number of users connected to internet is growing, mainly in Asia & Africa (2018-2023 8% CAGR). IOT (Machine 2 machine) is the part of the device lineup that's growing (10% CAGR) rapidly. High download speeds are not available in developing countries for fixed networks, but some do have great mobile options. Smartphones provide the most amount of traffic nowdays (30% CAGR in 17-22 for all device types). The kWh/GB ratio has improved by a lot, but we do use a lot more data now than we used to. Netflix goes up in energy consumption, even as they're using renewables, and video is driving more and more demand for bandwith and data transfer. Ericsson predicts that 5G mobile usage will go up a lot and fixed access won't grow as dramatically. There's energy usage for almost idle devices too, but network equipment has pretty much non-existing full load consumption increase.

### Key learnings
-Nielsen's Law, ie. internet speed is growing by 50% by year in the high end of the spectrum
-5G uses less energy than 4G only when the load goes up
-A lot of data is generated every second in Internet
-Size of web pages has grown 350% since 2011, they're not actually optimized for mobile devices
-Better video quality requires more data
-Online shopping has an environmental advantage compared to physical retail stores, even the biggest emission driver of last mile delivery has smaller footprint than going to store yourself

## 04.02.2025 Materials in ICT equipment

### Overview
Smartphone materials include a lot of different elements, including precious metals and REEs. Rare earth materials are not rare, but hard to extract in quantities (small concentrations in Earth's crust). By using more sofisticated materials we have more sofiticated functionality in our devices and products. The chemical complexity of products has increased.

Batteries are a big part of ICT devices. Lithium Ion batteries are 25% of the market and alkaline batteries still dominate the market with 66% in Finland (2022). Battery waste is growing, they're hazardous waste. LFP is also problematic, since it decreases the incentives to recycle (they're cheap). Battery recycling is also challenging, since the chemistry of batteries is evolving rapidly. Metal production aims to increase the concentration and purity of the desired material until it's usable in the end product/process. EOL for batteries is not currently planned for recycling, but there's some pressure for it in EU thanks to regulation (Raw Material Act). 

300 new mines could be needed to meet battery demand in 2035 and mining creates a lot or revenues & jobs. Pollution is a key negative impact, and Green colonialism is pushing indiginous people to the sidelines, since the metals are in such a demand. In theory minerals are indefinetely recycleable, but in practice it's more complicated, since they're present in small quantities. We aren't collecting enough of the waste we produce - unused devices go to landfill & stay at homes and businesses.

### Key learnings

- Clean energy transition is mineral-intensive, ie. an EV requires 2-4 times more of when compared to a lecagy car
- Metals produce positive impacts in electrification and ICT
- Critical raw materials are substances that are used in manufacting goods that are of high importance to the economy and whose supply is associated with high risk
- Urban mining is the process of "mining" the waste we produce, after urban mining the process is similar to primary metals extraction
- We should think about the material flows in a holistic way

## 11.02.2025 On electronics and repairability

### Overview
Ecological design is getting more and more important. Eco-design should be applied in a holistic manner. Measuring Cradle-to-gate LCA is sub-optimal, since it does not consider the usage of the device. ESPR, ie. Eco-design for Sustainable Products Regulation will provide pressure to companies to measure and improve their resource usage. One point is that electronics need to balance between environmental responsability and tech needs. Analyzing the the product requires a lot of effort and deep knowledge of the processes.

Common device changing reasons are: slowness, lack of security updates, dead battery, physical breakage, device is not repairable for a reasonable price, want for a fancier product. Materials acquisition, Design and manufacturing, use phase, EOL are the main life cycle stages. Repairing reduces waste, provides savings and conserves raw materials & the shipping & manufacturing energy. Smartphones produce 10's of kg's of co2, even as they weight under 0.5kg. The French have implemeted a repairability score and the manufacturers interpret the rules in their own favor. Some vendors are focusing on repairability, ie. Fairphone. It's important to extend the lifecycle of products - could you use the your old device for something else or use it for longer?

### Key learnings
- 75 Mt in 2030 of e-waste (Most of Asia in tons, per capita from Oceania & Europe)
- Europe is good with recycling (>40%), Africa is the worst (<1%)
- Storage increases emissions non-linearly (weight does not change that much)
- Manufacturing a server is equal to 186kkm in a Volvo XC60
- EU will have a repairability label and US has Right to Repair movement

## 25.02.2025 On Green Software

ICT sector accounts for 4-10% of global energy consumption and these numbers are growing. Software work has 3 bigger phases: development, testing & deployment and usage. Usage is the phase where most of the emissions occur, since that's where most of the time and work (as in energy) is done.

ICT's business logic is bringing new and fancier stuff to market - SaaS measures time to market, devs think about making their own life easier and efficiency & environmental issues are secondary or not considered at all. There little to no progress in making software environmentally responsible even as it would curb energy usage. The more operations & data we need/use, the more hardware we need and that increases demands for networks and premises - we consume more, it's a cascading effect. 

Cloud providers have incentives to use less energy or hardware. This leads to higher utilization and that's good for the environment. There isn't much transparency - nobody knows who has the most efficient systems.

Manufacturing -> logistics -> usage -> dismantling (negative effect on emissions, since can provide resources), is the cycle of hardware emissions. Data centers and networks produce most of their emissions in operative phase (80/20), but end user devices are about 50/50 (manufacturing/usage).

It's difficult to measure energy usage of software. There isn't a solid scientific framework for measurement. It's a good idea to measure electricity consumption over time. There aren't public measurement, so there's a lack of a benchmark. There a link between execution time and energy usage, if it's not possible to measure electricity consumption directly.

### Key learnings
- We consume more and more
- There's no agreed upon framework for measurement
- Minimal principle - the minimal possible solution to solve for needs of user and do nothing else
- E-waste is the growth leader of waste and we should keep old devices running as long as possible
- All energy production causes emissions, even renewables - Finland has 10x better (greener) grid than Germany. 34 gCo2/kWh vs. 385 gCO2/kWh

## 04.03.2025 AI

AI is the discipline of developing intelligent agents that encompases machine learning, deep learning, generative AI (ability to create new content based on what's learned). Types of DL models are Discriminate models (can classify cat pictures) and Generative AI models that can generate cat pictures (very compute intensive).

ML and AI models are build in 4 phases:	development (Collect data -> clean -> train), training (Live data and validation produces trained models), Inference (Query -> prediction (output of some sort)) and Monitoring.

### Measuring Energy

Measuring the consumption of DC's and the equipment used in DC's, and there's not much you can do.

### Measuring Emissions

Lifecycle emissions are produced in each phase (Product -> contructions -> maintain & use -> EOL -> beyond lifecycle), where maintain & use-phase is responsible for the most. Measuring operational carbon emissions is done by carbon intensity, which is how many grams of co2 /kwh (co2-equilevant) is being produced.

### Reports
Reports of energy & emissions from AI are provided by cloud vendors (there are obvious reliablity concerns in self reporting). Development-phase is computationally intensive and it's not studied extensively. Training-phase has been discussed a lot - 10-15% of Google's total energy consumption (19-21) and 40% of that was used for training. There are claims that it's a stable propotion of energy use in ML.

We can have an impact by reporting metrics if we're involved in development of models, choose providers and hardware cafefully and use the models in a responsible way.

### Key learnings
- Energy consumption is trending upwards
- Emission depend upon: ML-model (architecture, params, hours to train), Machines used (CPUs/GPUs/TPUs) perf/watt, Mechanization (Cloud computing, on-prem) and Geographical region (Carbon intensity of the electricity used)
- Image generation uses most resources, text classification the least (2 orders of magnitude)
- 40% of energy is used in training, 60% is used in inference and inference requests are growing
		
## 11.03.2025 On sustainability mindset

There are design condiderations for designing an ICT-system. Some of the needs are environmental, social, economic, individual and tech related. The scope of the effects are direct, indirect or structural.

All of our lives are embedded in ICT and there's no such thing as sustainable ICT, even as there's sustainablity in the society. They're inseparable. Think about stuff on the whole lifecycle of the device/service.

Some climate change effects are hard to understand, ie. Sulphur-rich shipping exhausts have actually cooled the earth. We have some real challenges like forever chemicals, microplastics in human fetuses, biodiversity loss and ever growing emissions.

It's not all doom & gloom, there's some hope too: Ozone layer is rejuvinating, green land area is growing, water cleanup was begun and plastic restrictions are on the horizon.

Prisoner's dilemma can be applied to sustainability thinking, it's basicly saying that taking short term (or short sighted) approach may produce good results in the short run, but we'll be worse off in the long run. Future can't be foretold, but we can affect how it's going to shape out. You can always ask a question: how can this be done more sustainably?

### Key learning (Tools for systemic thinking)
1. Interconnectedness understands how parts interacts and what phenomenons arise from the interactions
2. Feedback mechanisms recognises connection types and feedback mechanisms
3. Emergence is where whole is more than the sum of it's parts
4. How the Pieces Fit is understanding how and why certain pieces interact in particular way
5. Relationships is System dynamics (feedback loops, emergent phenomena)
6. Analysis and Synthesis are detail & 10k ft view

-Telia used 95& in energy, 4% in district heating and 1% in fuel
-KPI = kWh/GB with high quality
	-Too good quality is a problem too

### Key learnings
-Phone leases actually increase phone lifespan, since the leasing company is paying for the lease if the device is at someone's table drawer
